License Plate Obfuscator

Platon is an image upload service, which processes the uploaded image and obfuscates any license plate
it finds using machine learning.

Consider you want to sell your car and don't want to post your license plate on the internet. Ususally,
you would use a paint program and manually cover the license plate in each image with a black bar.
If your car sales website was smart, it could do that for you automatically while you upload.
